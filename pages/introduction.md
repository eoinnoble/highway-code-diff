Introduction
============

Who The Highway Code is for, how it's worded, and the consequences of not following the rules. 

Introduction
-------------

This Highway Code applies to England, Scotland and Wales. The Highway Code is essential reading for everyone.

The most vulnerable road users are pedestrians, particularly children, older or disabled people, cyclists, motorcyclists and horse riders. It is important that all road users are aware of the Code and are considerate towards each other. This applies to pedestrians as much as to drivers and riders.

Wording of The Highway Code
----------------------------

Many of the rules in the Code are legal requirements, and if you disobey these rules you are committing a criminal offence. You may be fined, given penalty points on your licence or be disqualified from driving. In the most serious cases you may be sent to prison. Such rules are identified by the use of the words ‘**MUST/MUST NOT**’. In addition, the rule includes an abbreviated reference to the legislation which creates the offence. See an [explanation of the abbreviations](/pages/annex-4-the-road-user-and-the-law.md#abbrev).

Although failure to comply with the other rules of the Code will not, in itself, cause a person to be prosecuted, The Highway Code may be used in evidence in any court proceedings under the Traffic Acts (see [The road user and the law](/pages/annex-4-the-road-user-and-the-law.md#roaduserlaw)) to establish liability. This includes rules which use advisory wording such as ‘should/should not’ or ‘do/do not’.

Knowing and applying the rules
-------------------------------

Knowing and applying the rules contained in The Highway Code could significantly reduce road casualties. Cutting the number of deaths and injuries that occur on our roads every day is a responsibility we all share. The Highway Code can help us discharge that responsibility.
