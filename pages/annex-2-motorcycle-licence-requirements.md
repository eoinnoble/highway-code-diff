If you have a provisional motorcycle licence, you **MUST** satisfactorily complete a Compulsory Basic Training (CBT) course.

You can then ride unaccompanied on the public road a motorcycle up to 125 cc, with a power output not exceeding 11 kW, with L plates (in Wales either D plates or L plates, or both, can be used), for up to two years.

**Law [RTA 1988 sect 97 (3)](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/52/section/97)**

**To ride a moped,** learners **MUST**

* be 16 or over
* have a provisional moped licence
* complete CBT training.

**Law [RTA 1988 sects 97(3)](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/52/section/97) & [101](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/52/section/101)**

You can then ride unaccompanied on the public road a two-wheeled vehicle with a maximum design speed of 45 km/h (28 mph), with L plates (in Wales either D plates or L plates, or both, can be used), for up to two years.

You **MUST** first pass the theory test for motorcycles and then the moped practical test to obtain your full moped licence.

**Law [MV(DL)R reg 38(4)](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1999/2864/regulation/38/made)**

**Note.**If you passed your car driving test before 1 February 2001 you are qualified to ride a moped without L plates (and/or D plates in Wales), although it is recommended that you complete CBT before riding on the road. If you passed your car driving test after this date you **MUST** complete CBT before riding a moped on the road.

Licence categories for mopeds and motorcycles
---------------------------------------------

**Category AM** (moped) – minimum age 16

* two-wheeled vehicle with a maximum design speed of 45 km/h (28 mph)
* three- or four-wheeled vehicle with a maximum design speed over 25 km/h (15.5 mph), up to 50 cc and with a power output not exceeding 4 kW.

**Category A1** – minimum age 17

* motorcycles up to 125 cc, with a power output not exceeding 11 kW
* tricycles with a power output not exceeding 15 kW.

**Category A2** – minimum age 19

* motorcycles with a power output not exceeding 35 kW.

**Category A**

* any motorcycle (the minimum age you can obtain a category A licence is 21 under progressive access or 24 under direct access)
* tricycles with a power output over 15 kW (minimum age 21).

Progressive access is a process that allows a rider to take a higher-category practical test if they already have at least two years’ experience on a lower-category motorcycle. For example, if you have held a category A2 licence for a minimum of two years, you can take the category A practical test at age 21. There is no requirement to take another theory test.

If you want to learn to ride motorcycles larger than 125 cc and with a power output over 11 kW, you **MUST** meet the minimum age requirements, satisfactorily complete a CBT course and be accompanied by an approved instructor on another motorcycle in radio contact.
