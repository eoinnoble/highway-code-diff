## Disclaimer

This is a **personal tool** that helps me keep up-to-date with all changes being made to the UK
Highway Code, but it may suffer from errors and/or omissions created during my attempts to parse
the text of [the official Highway Code website][1], therefore it is **not** intended to be a
substitute for reading [the official text][1] itself. If you are also trying to stay abreast of
changes to the Code you might also consider signing up for [the official email alerts][2].
